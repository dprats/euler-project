//12345 is pandigital because it digit is contained twice
//"7354 = 39 X 186" which is pandigital

//find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product
//can be written as 1 through 9 pandigital

//Initial upper bound pan digital number is 987,654,321
//However we know that its multiplier/multiplicand/product
